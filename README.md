# NMEA2000
NMEA2000 library for Arduino

Object oriented NMEA2000 library for Arduino Boards

Library gives you a easy way to make NMEA2000->PC interface like Actisense NGT1
or e.g. temperature sensor node to NMEA2000 bus.

To use Arduino Due board internal CAN you will also need NMEA2000_due library and
due_can library, which you can download from  https://github.com/collin80/due_can

To use Arduino boards with MCP2515 CAN bus controller, you will also need NMEA2000_mcp library
and mcp_can library, which you can download from https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield

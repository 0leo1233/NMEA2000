# Message sender
Example reads messages from NMEA 2000 bus and forwards them to serial in Actisense format.

Connect Arduino with this code to NMEA 2000 bus and listen port with Actisense NMEA Reader
so you will see all messages translated.

Note! I have noticed that Arduino Mega can not handle all messages, so I prefere Due for
using this.
